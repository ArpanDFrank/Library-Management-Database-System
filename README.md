# Library Management Database System

This repository contains the schema and scripts for a Library Management Database System. It's designed to efficiently manage library resources, member information, and borrowing/returning transactions.

## Features

* **Member Management:** Store and manage member details, including contact information and membership status.
* **Book Cataloging:** Track book information, including ISBN, title, author, genre, and availability.
* **Borrowing/Returning:** Record book lending and return transactions, including due dates and late fees.
* **Search and Filtering:** Enable efficient searching and filtering of books and members.
* **Reporting:** Generate reports on popular books, overdue books, and member activity.
* **Scalability:** Designed with scalability in mind to accommodate growing library collections and user bases.
* **Database Agnostic (Potentially):** The core SQL schema is designed to be adaptable to various relational database management systems (RDBMS) like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite (with minor adjustments).

## Database Schema

The database schema includes the following tables:

* **Members:** Stores member information (member ID, name, address, phone, etc.).
* **Books:** Stores book details (ISBN, title, author, genre, publication year, etc.).
* **Authors:** Stores author information (Author ID, Author Name).
* **Genres:** Stores genre information (Genre ID, Genre Name).
* **Borrowing:** Tracks book borrowing transactions (borrow ID, member ID, ISBN, borrow date, due date, return date).
* **Fines:** Stores fines incurred by members (fine ID, borrow ID, amount, payment date).
* **Book_Authors:** (Junction table) connects Books and Authors.
* **Book_Genres:** (Junction table) connects Books and Genres.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/library-management-db.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/your-username/library-management-db.git)
    cd library-management-db
    ```
2.  **Choose your RDBMS:** Select the database system you want to use (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite).
3.  **Create the database:** Use your RDBMS's command-line interface or GUI to create a new database.
4.  **Import the schema:** Execute the SQL scripts in the `schema` directory to create the tables. Adjust the SQL syntax if necessary to match your chosen RDBMS.
    * Example for PostgreSQL: `psql -d your_database_name -f schema/create_tables.sql`
    * Example for MySQL: `mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < schema/create_tables.sql`
    * Example for SQLite: `sqlite3 your_database_name.db < schema/create_tables.sql`
5.  **Populate with sample data (optional):** Execute the SQL scripts in the `data` directory to insert sample data into the tables.
    * Example for PostgreSQL: `psql -d your_database_name -f data/insert_data.sql`
    * Example for MySQL: `mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < data/insert_data.sql`
    * Example for SQLite: `sqlite3 your_database_name.db < data/insert_data.sql`

## Scripts

* **`schema/create_tables.sql`:** SQL script to create the database tables.
* **`data/insert_data.sql`:** SQL script to insert sample data.
* **`queries/`:** (Optional) Directory for example SQL queries.
